- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel somewhat confident with the content of arrays. I think the part where I'm not so confident is with all the methods. I believe this to be the case because it's new to me and just memorizing the methods. 
- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before   moving to the next lesson?
I believe repitition is key to remembering these arrays and their methods. When I have time on my calendar I believe I'll take advantage of that and go through this again and expand on my resources I found. 
- What questions do you have about Arrays?
I currently don't have questions about arrays.
